    "# Investigating Crop Quality in Beaune, France with Remote Sensing instruments for the 2022 vintage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to investigate the tools freely available to the public in monitoring the health of *Vitis Vinifera* grapes in the vineyard. This study will focus on the Burgundy region as it produces some of my favorite wines using Pinot Noir.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I investigate Landsat 9 imagery by interfacing with [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).\n",
    "I will calculate NDVI and a handful of other vegitation indexes to see which are useful and compare the freely available products to private options which may be better suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particular inspiration for this analysis came from [this study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.683078/full) conducted on a vineyard in Greece which concluded that *\"both satellite-based and proximal-based NDVI at both stages (veraison and harvest) presented good correlations to crop quality characteristics ...\"*. While this seems promising to my preliminary research it should be noted that the proximal based (in this study's case, drones within the vineyards) remote sensing applications were preffered to the remote sensing based (in this case Sentinel-2 archived imagery) instruments though I only have access to the remote sensing instruments and it is what I wish to investigate in this project.\n",
    "There are private companies like [VineView](https://vineview.com/data-products/vine-vigor-products/) and [VineScapes](https://www.vinescapes.com/read-our-published-work/) already using remote sensing techniques to offer insight into vineyard management.\n",
