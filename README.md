# Beaune, France an NDVI Exploration

One of my favorite wine producing regions in the world is Beaune, France. It also produces some of the world's most expensive wines thanks in part to its terroir, history, and everything else that affects the wine market.

I wanted to explore the region using freely available remote sensing tools (namely Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2) and do some quick analysis on the region's historical NDVI as it related to the wine's scores. While ultimately I ran out of time to properly analyze a correlation between the two, the exploration is nonetheless interesting to allow users to play with satellite images and better understand their potential.
